<h1> Nerd Nation 1: What is the Web?</h1></h1>
<b>The Basics of the Interwebs</b>
<p> Computers as we know them- 
laptops, desktops, and mobile devices- 
are all vehicles through which 
humans can access information.
Much of this information is found online, through websites.
Whenever a browser is opened and the address of a website is typed in, 
the computer automatically sends a request for information 
through the internet to a server using HTTP protocol. 
A server is a different type of computer 
that is optimized for hosting these files and pushing them out when necessary. 
As soon as the server recieves the request for data, 
it will send it back to the source of the request.  </p>
<b> 
  <p> Well... what is the web made from?</p>
</b>
<p> HTML documents are the heart of the web. 
  Although you will often find pictures and videos online,
  especially through the social media we experience so much of today,
  HTML is where it all started and how I am writing this today. 
  HTML has some
  interesting properties, such that it needs something
  called "tags" to make it deviate from its simple rules. 
  Without tags, for instance,
  HTML would be all one very long line.
</p>
<b> So... what is a tag then?</b>
<p>
  A tag is a command to the computer that is not simply
  one letter or one space, as can be done with simple 
  HTML. Examples of what you might do with tags are to 
  make the content <b>bold</b>,  make the text <i>italic</i>, or even insert a <a href="google.com"> link </a>!
   
</p>
<p> Tags are also super important in an HTML doc in general.
  Things like metadata, titles, and the ultimate structure of the page
  are determined by tags.
</p>

<p> <b> OK and... what should I remember for now?
</b></p>
<p> First of all, computers are stupid. When you are coding, 
they depend entirely on your command. They do not pick up on 
your tone, make inferences about your spelling, or ignore 
an extra comma. They will take everything you tell them and interpret it as such.
</p>
<p> Second, you do not need to remember everything. The beauty of 
  coding are the rules, and the beauty of a world wide web 
  <i>filled </i> with HTML, is your access to those rules.
</p>
<p> Last, remember the words 
<b> tag </b>, 
<b>element</b>, 
and 
<b>attribute</b>. A <b>tag</b> is a command, set between brackets. 
An <b>element</b> is the content between an opening and closing tag.
  An <b> attribute</b> is a property of an HTML element, which you can 
  set equal to something else.
